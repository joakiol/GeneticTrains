# Project for Techniques of Artificial Intelligence, UPV

In this project I've been working with making train schedules using the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. 

- Report_TIA_JoakimOlsen.pdf contains the report of the project. 

- trains.py contains design functions to calculate fitness and visualize solutions.

- genetic.py contains the implemented genetic algorithm.

- enfri.py contains the implemented simulated annealing algorithm..

- main.py contains functions to do all the plots in the report/presentation

All the functions are run from the main function in main. They are listed with a comment of what they do. All of these are currently commented. To run any of the plots, simply uncomment, run and enjoy :)
